                <p>Let your child help with the cooking. They won’t eat the finished product, but at least it will take twice as long and there will be a huge mess to clean up</p>

                <p>Don’t tell your child they have to finish their vegetables in order to get their dessert. According to the experts, this will give your child food issues and make them hate vegetables. Instead, vaguely sputter about healthy eating and then wonder how the hell you will ever get your damned pie if you wait for them to voluntarily eat vegetables</p>

                    <p>Don’t force them to eat. They will eat when they are hungry. Eventually you may even learn to ignore that gnawing feeling of shame when you send your starving child off to bed</p>
